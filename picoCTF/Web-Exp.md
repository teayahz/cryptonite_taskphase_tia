# SOAP

**Flag:** `picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_4dbeb2ed}`

**Solution:**
- The challenge gives a website whose `/etc/passwd` file is to be read with *XML external entity injection* (XXE).
- I opened a browser in Burp Suite and put in the provided URL & clicked on the third Details button.
- This sent a POST request, which I sent to Repeater.
- To perform XXE injection, I had to change the following script in the Request tab according to it.
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<data>
  <ID>
    3
  </ID>
</data>
```
XXE Payload:
```
< ?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"? >
< !DOCTYPE foo [ 
	<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> 
	] >
	<data><ID>
		&xxe;
	</ID></data>
```

- On hitting Send, the flag was visible in the last line of the Response section.

**Concepts learnt:**
1. XML External Entity Injection which is a vulnerability which exploits the processing of XML data, and the XML code for XXE injection payload
2. The contents of the `/etc/passwd` file which is info on users 

**Mistakes & other approaches:**
- I had to turn Intercept Off & then On to receive the request from the site.

# Forbidden Paths

**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}`

**Solution:**
- The main hint in the challenge was the fact that the website was filtering *absolute* file paths. 
- I noticed the .txt files listed on the website given. http://saturn.picoctf.net:<port\>.
- ![forbidden paths](https://github.com/teayahz/cryptonite_taskphase_tia/blob/main/picoCTF/images/webex1.JPG?raw=true)
- By using the knowledge of absolute vs relative paths, I remembered relative paths don't start with a `/`(root directory), and that other directories in the path can be represented by `../` .
- To get the file, I entered `../../../../flag.txt` as the description said the file was in `/usr/share/nginx/html/`.


**Concepts learnt:**
1.  I recalled the use of `..` to symbolise parent directory.

**Mistakes & other approaches:**
- First, I tried editing the URL directly with the path provided and it didn't work. 
- I also tried entering the given files names on the home page, but they seemed to be not be found

# Cookies

**Flag:** `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_a1f5bdb7}`

**Solution:**
- The challenge provides a website with an input box for types of cookies. So, I entered various cookie names such as snickerdoodle, chocolate chip, gingerbread, crinkle, etc and observed the *cookie* values change from 0 to ~25 in the Application tab, where -1 was the initial value.
- I realised a specific value of the cookie gives the flag. I installed *Burp Suite (Community Edition)* for the purpose of checking the response upon changing cookie value one by one. 
- I sent  `mercury.picoctf.net:29649/check` to Intruder, set a payload around the cookie value using `Cookie: name=ยง-1ยง`. I changed *Payloads* type to numbers and set a range from 0 to 20 and started the attack.

 - The output had columns like the request number, payload, length, response received and status code. I then went to settings and scrolled to the `Grep - Match` section and added `picoCTF{` to the search queries to find the flag in the responses. It was found in payload 18 and the length here also differed from the other payload values.

**Concepts learnt:**
1. Learnt the use of Burp Suite for taking in requests, changing them and generating the required responses.

**Mistakes & other approaches:**
- After finding the value of the cookie, it could also be directly edited in the website to get the flag there.
- A Python script can be used instead of installing Burp Suite, where there's a loop from 1 to 20 to change the value of the cookies and get the response using `import requests`. 
```python
#!/bin/python3
import requests
url = 'http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/check'
for i in range(20):
    cookies = {'name': str(i)}
    r = requests.get(url,cookies=cookies)
    if 'picoCTF' in r.text:
        print(r.text)
        break
```
The output in the terminal was the code when the cookie is changed to the value having a response with the required flag:
```
