#Intro-to-Arguments

First, by executing `echo Hello`, I learnt that `echo` is the *command* while `Hello` is an *argument*. `echo` returns or displays back the argument(s) entered with it. 

To get the flag, I had to use `hello` as the command and `hackers` as an argument, and so I put in `hello hackers`.
